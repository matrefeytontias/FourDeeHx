- Find a way to make textures a thing : mapped to cells ? faces ? behaviour of a textured slice ?
- When that's done, bump maps should follow
- Make it possible to insert 3D objects in the scene, in a way that is consistent with the idea of 4D space and what's implemented so far
- Same for HUD elements
- Most environment features found in a 3D engine I guess : skyboxes, lensflares etc
