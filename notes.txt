- Find a way to make textures a thing : mapped to cells ? faces ? behaviour of a textured slice ?
- When that's done, bump maps should follow
- Make it possible to insert 3D objects in the scene, in a way that is consistent with the idea of 4D space and what's implemented so far
- Same for HUD elements
- Most environment features found in a 3D engine I guess : skyboxes etc
- Work out backcell culling with 4D cross product
- Work out 4D isotropic lighting : equivalent 3D isotropic light in the intersector ? Idea : try from 3D to 2D first and generalize
